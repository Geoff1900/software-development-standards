- Write clearly and concisely for a technical audience
- Use short, well-structured sentences
- Use headings, bullet points, and lists to improve readability
- Make content easy to scan and navigate
- Front-load key information at the start of sections
- Focus on helping the reader understand concepts or complete tasks
- Avoid unnecessary jargon, but use precise technical language where appropriate
- Explain acronyms on first use
- Use a professional and direct tone (avoid overly informal or conversational language)
- Prefer active voice where it improves clarity


## Standards Language (RFC 2119)

This handbook uses RFC 2119 terminology to define requirement levels.

When writing standards or guidance:

- Use terms such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL as defined in RFC 2119
- Only use these terms where normative language is intended
- Do not use these terms casually or interchangeably with everyday language
- Ensure consistency with existing handbook content

## Working with Documentation

### Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS read files before editing** - Understand current content and structure
2. **All documentation lives in `/doc` directory** - Create new files here
3. **Update navigation** - When adding/removing pages, update `zensical.toml`
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Match formatting, structure, and style
5. **Test locally** - Start dev server to verify changes render correctly
6. **Security & PHI** - NEVER commit patient data (PHI), secrets, or credentials
7. **British English** - Follow NHS Wales language standards

### Standard Workflow

```text
Read file(s) → Make edits → Update navigation (if needed) → Test → Lint/Spell → Commit
```

### Documentation Updates

**Before editing:**

- Read the target file to understand current content
- Check related files for context and patterns
- Review existing formatting and structure

**When editing:**

- Use [Python Markdown](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/markdown/) with Zensical extensions
- Follow existing heading hierarchy
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use paths relative to the current file for internal links, for example:
  - From a root-level page: `[Link text](section/page.md)`
  - From a nested page: `[Link text](../section/page.md)`
- Place images in `doc/assets/` and reference them with paths relative to the current file, for example:
  - From a root-level page: `![Alt text](assets/image.png)`
  - From a nested page: `![Alt text](../assets/image.png)`

**Key Markdown Extensions Available:**

- **[Admonitions](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/admonitions/)** - Callout boxes (tip, example, warning, info, note, etc.)
- **[Code Blocks](https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/code-blocks/)** - Syntax highlighting with line numbers and annotations
- **Footnotes** - Reference-style footnotes
- **Tables** - Standard markdown tables
- **Tabbed content** - Multi-tab content blocks
- **Mermaid diagrams** - Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.

**Standard admonitions used in this handbook:**

```markdown
!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Use this for practical tips and recommendations

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    Use this for examples of good practice

!!! warning "Practices to avoid"
    Use this for practices to avoid

!!! info "Further reading and information"
    Use this for links to further guides, information and work instructions
```

See `doc/software-development-handbook/introduction.md` for live examples.

### Adding New Pages

1. **Create markdown file** in appropriate `/doc` subdirectory
   - Follow naming: lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., `my-new-page.md`)

2. **Update `zensical.toml` navigation:**

   ```toml
   nav = [
      {"Section Name" = [
         {"New Page Title" = "section-name/new-page.md"},
      ]},
   ]
   ```

3. **Test navigation** appears correctly in dev server

### Modifying Navigation

The `zensical.toml` file is organized into sections:

- **`[project]`** - Site metadata (name, description, URLs)
- **`nav`** - Navigation structure (update when adding/removing pages)
- **`[project.markdown_extensions.<..>]`** - Markdown extensions and settings
- **`[project.theme]`** - Theme configuration (logo, features, colors, fonts)

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] Read files before editing to understand context
- [ ] Follow existing formatting and structure patterns
- [ ] Use correct relative paths for links and images
- [ ] Update `zensical.toml` navigation if adding/removing pages
- [ ] Verify markdown syntax is correct
- [ ] Run `just lint` and fix all issues
- [ ] Run `just spell` and fix all issues
- [ ] Check for secrets/credentials or PHI (DO NOT COMMIT)
- [ ] Test in dev server if possible

### Linting & Validation

**Markdown Linting** (`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`):

- Defines deviations from default markdown linting rules
- Lint all changed documents: `just lint`
- Fix all errors before committing

**Spell Checking** (`cspell.json`):

- Custom dictionary includes healthcare/tech terms
- Language: British English (en-GB)
- Check spelling: `just spell`
- Add new terms to the `words` array in `cspell.json` (alphabetically)

### Local Testing

```bash
just run
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
# Verify: pages load, navigation works, links resolve, images display
```

### Build Testing

```bash
just build
# Check terminal output for errors or warnings
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions automatically runs on pull requests:

- **Quality Assurance** (`.github/workflows/pr-quality.yml`):
  - Validates markdown files
  - Checks spelling
  - Verifies internal links

- **Documentation** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`):
  - Builds the site
  - Deploys to GitHub Pages (on main branch only)

- **Copilot Setup Steps** (`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`):
  - Installs dependencies for Copilot agents
  - Ensures environment is ready

Check workflow files in `.github/workflows/` for detailed configuration.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Documentation Section

1. Create directory: `mkdir -p doc/new-section-name`
2. Create `introduction.md` as the section landing page
3. Add section to `zensical.toml` navigation array
4. Create additional pages as needed
5. Test navigation appears correctly

**Example navigation entry:**

```toml
{"New Section Name" = [
  {"Introduction" = "new-section-name/introduction.md"},
  {"Topic One" = "new-section-name/topic-one.md"},
]},
```

### Updating Existing Content

1. **Read the file first** to understand current content
2. **Make targeted edits** using precise changes
3. **Verify locally** via dev server if possible
4. **Lint and spell check** before committing
5. **Commit changes** with clear message explaining "why"

### Working with Images

- **Location:** All images go in `doc/assets/`
- **Naming:** Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `api-workflow-diagram.png`)
- **References in markdown:** `![Descriptive alt text](../assets/image-name.png)`
- **Path notes:** Use relative paths; `../` navigates up one directory

### Adding Code Examples

**Syntax-highlighted code blocks:**

````markdown
```python
def calculate_risk_score(patient_data):
    """Calculate patient risk score for NHS Wales system."""
    return risk_score
```
````

**Supported languages:** python, typescript, javascript, sql, bash, yaml, toml, json, csharp, xml, and more.

### Adding Technical Terms to Spell Checker

If using NHS Wales or healthcare-specific terms:

1. Read `cspell.json`
2. Add term to the `words` array (alphabetically)
3. Commit with clear explanation

Example:

```json
"words": [
    "DHCW",
    "FHIR",
    "mynewterm",
    "WCAG"
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build/Server Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Module not found | Run `just sync` to reinstall dependencies |
| Build fails | Check `zensical.toml` syntax; verify all referenced files exist |
| Page not appearing | Verify navigation entry in `zensical.toml` matches file path exactly |
| Broken links | Check relative paths; ensure target files exist |
| Images not loading | Verify path and that image is in `doc/assets/` |
| Markdown not rendering | Check for syntax errors; ensure proper code block fencing |
| Port 8000 in use | Stop existing server or use different port |

### Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting to update navigation** after adding/removing pages
- **Incorrect relative paths** in links (remember `../` to go up a directory)
- **Creating files outside `/doc`** directory
- **Not reading files before editing** (leads to incorrect assumptions)
- **Inconsistent formatting** (not matching existing style)
- **Using American English** instead of British English
- **Committing without testing** locally first

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **Main branch:** `main`
- **Feature branches:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `feature/add-python-standards`, `fix/broken-links`, `docs/update-api-standards`)
- **Copilot branches:** Typically start with `copilot/`

### Commit Best Practices

**Commit message format:**

```text
Brief summary (50 chars or less)

- Detailed change 1 explaining why not just what
- Detailed change 2
- Reference issue/PR numbers if applicable
```

**Example good commit:**

```text
Add Python coding standards section

- Include PEP 8 compliance guidelines
- Add examples for common patterns
- Link to Azure DevOps pipeline configuration
- Fixes #123
```

### Standard Git Flow

```bash
git status                    # Verify changes
git diff                      # Review changes
git add [files]               # Stage specific files
git commit -m "message"       # Commit with clear message
git push -u origin [branch]   # Push to remote
```

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### Core Principles

1. **Read First, Edit Second**
   - Always read files before making changes
   - Understand context, structure, and existing patterns
   - Check related files for consistency

2. **Minimize File Creation**
   - Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
   - Only create files when explicitly required
   - Do not create unnecessary documentation files proactively

3. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   - Match heading styles, formatting, and structure
   - Use similar language and tone
   - Check multiple examples before implementing

4. **Verify Navigation**
   - Update `zensical.toml` when adding/removing pages
   - Test that navigation appears correctly
   - Ensure paths match exactly (case-sensitive)

5. **Healthcare Context Awareness**
   - This is NHS Wales guidance - accuracy is critical
   - Healthcare software errors can have serious consequences
   - Maintain professional, clear, precise language
   - Double-check medical/technical terminology

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Creating documentation files proactively (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- ❌ Making assumptions about file contents without reading them
- ❌ Adding features or improvements beyond what was requested
- ❌ Using placeholder values instead of reading actual content
- ❌ Batch committing multiple unrelated changes
- ❌ Over-engineering solutions or adding unnecessary complexity
- ❌ Ignoring existing conventions in favor of "better" approaches
- ❌ Using American English spelling instead of British English

### Pre-Commit Validation

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] Read all files you edited
- [ ] Changes match existing style and structure
- [ ] Navigation updated if pages added/removed
- [ ] Links use correct relative paths
- [ ] Images referenced are in `doc/assets/`
- [ ] Code blocks have language specifiers
- [ ] Ran `just lint` with no errors
- [ ] Ran `just spell` with no errors
- [ ] Tested in dev server if possible
- [ ] Commit message is clear and explains "why"
- [ ] Only relevant files are staged

## Security Best Practices

### NEVER Commit

- Patient data (PHI - Protected Health Information)
- API keys or access tokens
- Passwords or credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- Any sensitive NHS Wales data

### GitHub Actions Security

- Pin GitHub Actions to full-length commit SHAs instead of tags for supply-chain security
- Example: `actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11` # v4.1.1 instead of `actions/checkout@v6`
- Include version comments for maintainability

# Software development handbook

This site shares Digital Health and Care Wales' (DHCW) software development standards.
Until now, these have only been available to internal staff.

## Why have a handbook?

When you're building software, especially in healthcare, good guidance really matters. It helps everyone work in a consistent way, so the code is easier to understand, safer, and more reliable.

A handbook brings together all the important know-how: how to write clear, secure code; how to manage changes properly; how to work well across teams; and how to meet the expectations of modern software development.

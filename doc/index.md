# Software development handbook 

This site shares Digital Health and Care Wales' (DHCW) software development standards. 
Until now, these have only been available to internal staff.

### Why have a handbook?

When you're building software, especially in healthcare, good guidance really matters. It helps everyone work in a consistent way, so the code is easier to understand, safer, and more reliable. 

A handbook brings together all the important know-how: how to write clear, secure code; how to manage changes properly; how to work well across teams; and how to meet the expectations of modern software development. 

It's there to help you make good decisions, avoid mistakes, and deliver software that others can trust and build on.

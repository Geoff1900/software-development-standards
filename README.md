## Introduction

When you're building software, especially in healthcare, good guidance really matters. It helps everyone work in a consistent way, so the code is easier to understand, safer, and more reliable.

A handbook brings together all the important know-how: how to write clear, secure code; how to manage changes properly; how to work well across teams; and how to meet the expectations of modern software development.

It's there to help you make good decisions, avoid mistakes, and deliver software that others can trust and build on.

## Getting Started

There are several ways to set up your development environment:

### 1. GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The fastest way to start contributing:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/GIGCymru/dhcw-software-engineering-handbook?quickstart=1)

This provides:

* A pre-configured VS Code environment (with useful extensions installed)
* All required dependencies installed
* Automatic port forwarding for preview
* Git integration

Once you have successfully launched Codespaces you can run the
development server from the VS Code Terminal:

```bash
    just run
```

You will be prompted to **Open in Browser** to view the locally running site.

All dependencies are automatically installed during container creation. Use `just --list`
to discover all available commands.

See the [Quickstart Guide](http://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart) for
more information.

Note: It can take a few minutes to fully launch Codespaces the first time, but
is faster on subsequent launches as the environment is then cached.

### 2. Local Development

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.13 or higher
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for package/env management
* Git

**Setup Steps:**

Clone the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GIGCymru/dhcw-software-engineering-handbook.git
    cd dhcw-software-engineering-handbook
```

Install uv (if not already installed):

```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Set up environment and dependencies:

```bash
    uv sync
```

Install the npm dependencies that provide the CLI tools used for spell checking and markdown linting:

```bash
    npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
    uv run zensical serve
```

### 3. Container-based Development

If you prefer using containers:

**Prerequisites:**

* [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**Setup Steps:**

Build the container:

```bash
    podman build --tag zensical .
```

Run the development server:

```bash
    podman run -p 8000:8000 zensical
```

### 4. Just-based Workflow

For those who prefer command runners, this project uses [Just](https://github.com/casey/just):

**Installation:**

```bash
    # macOS
    brew install just

    # Linux
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin

    # Windows (via cargo)
    cargo install just

    # See https://github.com/casey/just#installation for more options
```

**Usage:**

```bash
    # See all available commands
    just --list

    # Full build and serve
    just

    # Quick start development server
    just run
```
